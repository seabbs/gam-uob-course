# Recap

- Models fitted using penalized log-likelihood

# Model fitting

- Use a hierarchical fitting framework
- Variance parameters of random effect can be incluedd in model fitting
- Smooths in gam are highly generalised and include all GLM parameter types + multiple tpyes of splines
- Cyclic basis can be used for rotating signals
- Read simon woods book

# Big data methods

- handles matrix algebra differently. Performing calculations on sub-blocks rather than on the complete matrix.
